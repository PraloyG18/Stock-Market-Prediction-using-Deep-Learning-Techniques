# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning-Techniques

This project focuses on predicting stock market trends using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. It explores various algorithms to analyze and forecast stock price movements based on historical data.

Overview

The goal of this project is to build predictive models capable of identifying future stock price trends. The notebook includes complete steps from data loading, exploration, preprocessing, and visualization, to model training and evaluation.
